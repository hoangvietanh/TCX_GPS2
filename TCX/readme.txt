If you install TCX Converter and you are not part of the Administrators User Group, the installer have some problems to create a dir, so you have to extract the file settings.set from the file FORVISTA.zip (it is inside the TCX Converter install dir) and place it in c:\Users\[username]/AppData/Roaming/TCXConverter.

Decompress and copy the folder garmintrack from garmintrack.zip (it is inside the TCX Converter install dir) in your CompeGPS symbol folder (for example C:\Programmi\CompeGPS\symbols\).
